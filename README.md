# Telegram Bot boilerplate

This is a boilerplate code for creating Telegram bots.

I made it because I'm tired of doing same things again every time.

## Usage

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/vovanz/telegram-bot-boilerplate.git your-new-project
cd your-new-project/
# remove origin
git remote rm origin
# add new origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/your-new-project.git
git push -u origin master
```
